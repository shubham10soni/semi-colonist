MySQL variables provide a powerful way to store and manipulate data within your database. This cheat sheet provides a quick reference guide to MySQL variables along with practical examples and best practices.

## What are Variables in MySQL?

In simple terms, a variable in MySQL is a named storage location that holds a data value. These values canbe of various types, such as integers, strings, dates, or even complex data structures. Variables are widely used in MySQL for tasks suchas storing query results, passing parameters to stored procedures, and controlling the flow of SQL statements.

Declaring and assigning variables in MySQL is done using the `SET` statement. Here's the basic syntax:

```sql
SET @variable_name = value;
```

For example, to assign the value 10 to a variable named `x`, you would write:

```sql
SET @x = 10;
```

You can also declare multiple variables and assign values to them in a single statement:

```sql
SET @x = 10, @y = 'Hello', @z = NOW();
```

In MySQL, the `DECLARE` keyword is used to declare variables with in stored programs such as stored procedures, functions, triggers, or compound statements. This keyword allows you to define variables that can be used to store data temporarily and perform various operations within the scope of the program.

The basic syntax for declaring variables using the `DECLARE` keyword is as follows:

```sql
DECLARE variable_name data_type [DEFAULT value];
```

Here's what each part of the syntax represents:

- `DECLARE`: This keyword signals the beginning of a variable declaration.
- `variable_name`: This is the name of the variable you are declaring. It must follow the rules for naming identifiers in MySQL.
- `data_type`: This specifies the data type of the variable, such as `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, etc.
- `DEFAULT value` (optional): This part allows you to assign an initial value to the variable upon declaration. If not specified, the variable will be initialized to `NULL` by default.

Here's a simple example of declaring a variable named `counter` of type `INT` with an initial value of `0`:

```sql
DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 0;
```

Once declared, you can then use this variable with in the stored program to store and manipulate data as needed.

## The Assignment Operator (:=)

In MySQL, the := assignment operator is primarily used outside of SELECT statements to assign values to variables. This operator is not intended for use with in SELECT statements to assign values to variables directly from the result set. Instead, MySQL provides the INTO clause for this purpose.

```sql
-- Declare variables
SET @first_name := '';
SET @last_name := '';

-- Select and assign values
SELECT first_name, last_name
INTO @first_name, @last_name
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 100;

-- Now @first_name and @last_name variables contain the values retrieved from the query
SELECT @first_name, @last_name;
```

> üí° Note:
> The reason you cannot use := inside a SELECT statement directly to assign values to variables is because the syntax of a SELECT statement is specifically designed to retrieve data from tables and views, not to perform assignments.
>
> The := operator is used for variable assignment in SQL statements such as SET, DECLARE, and SELECT...INTO, but it's not part of the standard SELECT syntax for fetching data.
>
> However, other database systems might have different functionalities or syntax. For instance, PostgreSQL allows variable assignment with in a SELECT statement using the := operator. So, the ability to use := inside a SELECT statement can depend onthe specific database system you're using and its supported syntax.
>
> ```sql
> mysql> SELECT @max_salary := MAX(salary) FROM employees;
> +----------------------------+
> | @max_salary := MAX(salary) |
> +----------------------------+
> |                   62000.00 |
> +----------------------------+
> 1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
> mysql> show warnings;
> +---------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
> | Level | Code | Message |
> +---------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
> | Warning | 1287 | Setting user variables within expressions is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Consider alternatives: 'SET variable=expression, ...', or 'SELECT expression(s) INTO variables(s)'. |
> +---------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
> 1 row in set (0.00 sec)
> mysql> select @max_salary;
> +-------------+
> | @max_salary |
> +-------------+
> | 62000.00 |
> +-------------+
> 1 row in set (0.00 sec)
> ```

## Types of Variables

### 1. User-defined Variables

User-defined variables are created by the user and persist throughout the session. They start with the `@` symbol followed by the variable name.

**Example:**

```sql
SET @total_cost = @price * @quantity;
```

**Use Case:** Calculating the total cost of items in a shopping cart, considering the price per item and quantity.

### 2. Session Variables

Session variables are specific to a single session and are reset when the session ends. They can be set using the `SET SESSION` statement.

**Example:**

```sql
SET SESSION sql_mode = 'STRICT_ALL_TABLES';
```

**Use Case:** Enforcing strict SQL mode for the current session to ensure data integrity.

### 3. Global Variables

Global variables affect the entire MySQL server and persist across sessions. They canbe set using the `SET GLOBAL` statement.

**Example:**

```sql
SET GLOBAL max_connections = 100;
```

**Use Case:** Configuring the maximum number of allowed connections to the MySQL server.

### 4. System Variables

System variables control the behavior of the MySQL server and can be viewed using `SHOW VARIABLES`.

**Example:**

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections';
```

**Use Case:** Checking the maximum number of connections allowed by the MySQL server.

### 5. Predefined Variables

MySQL provides predefined variables that offer information about the server configuration or status. These variables are accessed using the `@@` prefix followed by the variable name.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT @@version;
```

**Use Case:** Retrieving the version of the MySQL server.

## **Understanding Special, Dynamic, and Predefined Variables**

**1. Special Variables:**
Special variables provide insights in to server configuration and control specific behaviors. They are prefixed with `@@` and are typically read-only. Examples include `@@version`, `@@global.max_connections`, and `@@session.sql_mode`.

_Example:_

```sql
-- Retrieve MySQL server version
SELECT @@version;
```

**2. Dynamic Variables:**
Dynamic variables allow runtime parameter adjustments without server restart. Prefixed with `@`, they can be set at session or global level and are modifiable using `SET` statements. Examples include `@max_connections`, `@wait_timeout`, etc.

_Example:_

```sql
-- Set maximum connections for the current session
SET @max_connections = 100;
```

**3. Predefined Variables:**
Predefined variables are built-in and offer server configuration information. They include both special and dynamic variables.

**Difference:**

- **Special vs. Dynamic Variables:** Special variables provide server insights and control, while dynamic variables allow runtime adjustments. Special variables use `@@` prefix, while dynamic variables use `@`.
- **Predefined vs. User-defined Variables:** Predefined variables are built-in and set by MySQL, while dynamic variables are user-defined and modifiable during runtime.

Understanding these variable types helps optimize MySQL server configurations and operations efficiently.

## **Variable Scope in MySQL**

Variables in MySQL have a scope, which determines where they canbe accessed and modified. The scope of a variable refers to the part of the code where the variable is visible and can be used. There are mainly three scopes for variables:

1. **Global Scope:**

   - Global variables are accessible from anywhere within the MySQL server.
   - They are defined at the server level and persist across sessions.
   - Changes made to global variables affect the entire server.
   - Example:

```sql
-- Set global variable
SET GLOBAL @global_var = 10;
```

2. **Session Scope:**

   - Session variables are specific to a single client session.
   - They are defined when a client connects to the server and exist until the session ends.
   - Changes made to session variables affect only the current session and do not impact other sessions.
   - Examples:

```sql
-- Set session variable
SET @session_var = 20;
```

3. **Local Scope:**
   - Local variables are confined to a specific block of code, such as a stored procedure, function, or trigger.
   - They are defined within the block of code where they are used and exist only within that block.
   - Changes made to local variables are limited to the scope of the block of code where they are defined.
     _Example:_

```sql
-- Stored procedure with local variable
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE example_procedure()
BEGIN
    DECLARE local_var INT;
    SET local_var = 30;
    -- Use local_var within the stored procedure
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

Understanding the scope of variables is essential for writing efficient and organized code, as it helps prevent naming conflicts and ensures that variables are accessible where they are needed.

## Usage and Best Practices

Variables in MySQL have various use cases, including:

- Storing and manipulating query results.
- Passing parameters to stored procedures and functions.
- Dynamic control of server settings.
- Conditional logic and flow control within SQL statements.

### Usage of Variables in SQL Statements

#### Select Statement with Variables

```sql
SET @threshold_price = 500;

SELECT product_name, product_price
FROM products
WHERE product_price > @threshold_price;
```

#### Insert Statement with Variables

```sql
SET @customer_id = 1001;
SET @order_date = '2024-03-20';

INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date)
VALUES (@customer_id, @order_date);
```

#### Update Statement with Variables

```sql
SET @discount_rate = 0.1;

UPDATE products
SET product_price = product_price - (product_price * @discount_rate);
```

#### Delete Statement with Variables

```sql
SET @order_id = 1023;

DELETE FROM orders
WHERE order_id = @order_id;
```

### Best Practices

- Choose meaningful variable names to improve code readability.
- Avoid overusing variables, especially in performance-sensitive queries.
- Be mindful of variable scope and ensure proper initialization and cleanup.
- Comment your code to document the purpose and usage of variables.

## Conclusion

MySQL variables offer a flexible and efficient way to manage data and control server behavior. By understanding types of variables, their usage in SQL statements, and best practices, you can optimize query performance, streamline data manipulation, and enhance the overall efficiency of your MySQL database environment.
